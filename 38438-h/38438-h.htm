<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>How many of us are conscious of the subtle melodies, "through which the
myriad lispings of the earth find perfect speech"?</p>

<p>Our poets are listeners; their ears are tuned to the magic call of
secret voices that we who are not singers may never hear. They capture
the "Melody" in chalices of song, and their message is: that whosoever
will bend his ear to earth, may hear from field and furrow, from the
many-bladed grass and the soft-petalled flowers&mdash;in the soughing of the
pine tree or the rustle of leaves&mdash;an immortal music that revivifies the
soul.</p>

<p>In the quiet tilled spots of earth, from time immemorial, men have sown
rare seeds of poetic thought that have flowered into song. Amiel wrote
in his <i>Journal</i>: "All seed-sowing is a mysterious thing whether the
seed fall into earth or into souls; man is a husbandman, and his work
rightly understood is to develop life, to sow it everywhere." The poets
are our seed-sowers, and <i>their</i> work is to develop life and to enrich
it. They are never happier than when writing about gardens and the
growing things of earth&mdash;at once their symbol and their solace. In turn
gardens have in the poets their happiest interpreters.</p>

<p>Here I have culled and gathered together songs and poems that reflect
the melody and harmony of Nature's forces. In these days of the world's
travail, let us seek inspiration and content within the delightful
confines of these Gardens of Poetry.</p>

<h3>THE FOUNTAIN</h3>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">I thought my garden finished. I beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each bush bee-visited; a green charm quelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The louder winds to music; soft boughs made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patches of silver dusk and purple shade&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I felt a lack of something still.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">There was a little, sleepy-footed rill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lapsed among sun-burnished stones, where slept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fish, rainbow-scaled, while dragon-flies, adept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balanced on bending grass.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i22">All perfect? No.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My garden lacked a fountain's upward flow.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I coaxed the brook's young Naiad to resign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her meadow wildness, building her a shrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of worship, where each ravished waif of air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might wanton in the brightness of her hair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">So here my fountain flows, loved of the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every vagrant, aimless gust inclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet constant ever to its source. It greets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of morning, wavering windy sheets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woven silver; sheer it climbs the noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shaft of bronze; and underneath the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sleeps in pearl and opal. In the storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It streams far out, a wild, gray, blowing form;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on calm days it heaps above the lake,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pelting the dreaming lilies half awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pattering jewels on each wide, green frond,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recurrent pyramids of diamond!<br /></span>

<h3>THE JULY GARDEN</h3>

<span class="i0">It's July in my garden; and steel-blue are the globe thistles<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And French grey the willows that bow to every breeze;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"I'm picking, I'm picking, I'm picking these!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">So off I go to rout them, and find instead I'm gazing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At clusters of delphiniums&mdash;the seed was small and brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But these are spurs that fell from heaven and caught the most amazing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Colours of the welkin's own as they came hustling down.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">And then some roses catch my eye, or may be some Sweet Williams<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or pink and white and purple peals of Canterbury bells<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or pencilled Violas that peep between the three-leaved trilliums<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or red-hot pokers all aglow or poppies that cast spells&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">And while I stare at each in turn I quite forget or pardon<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The blackbirds&mdash;and the blackguards&mdash;that keep robbing me of pie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what do such things matter when I have so fair a garden<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And what is half so lovely as my garden in July?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Within the arbor, script forgot, I muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While gorgeous hollyhocks sway to and fro<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There's something in a noble tree&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What shall I say? a soul?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'tis not form, or aught we see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In leaf or branch or bole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some presence, though not understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dwells there alway, and seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be acquainted with our mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And mingles in our dreams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">I would not say that trees at all<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were of our blood and race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, lingering where their shadows fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I sometimes think I trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kinship, whose far-reaching root<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grew when the world began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made them best of all things mute<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To be the friends of man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Held down by whatsoever might<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unto an earthly sod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stretch forth arms for air and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As we do after God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when in all their boughs the breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Moans loud, or softly sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As our own hearts in us, the trees<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are almost human things.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What wonder in the days that burned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With old poetic dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead Phaëthon's fair sisters turned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To poplars by the stream!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many a light cotillion stept<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The trees when fluters blew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a tear, 'tis said, they wept<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For human sorrow too.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Mute, said I? They are seldom thus;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They whisper each to each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each and all of them to us,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In varied forms of speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be serious," the solemn pine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is saying overhead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be beautiful," the elm-tree fine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has always finely said;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">"Be quick to feel," the aspen still<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Repeats the whole day long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, from the green slope of the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The oak-tree adds, "Be strong."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with my burden, as I hear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their distant voices call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rise, and listen, and draw near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Be patient," say they all.<br /></span>

<h3>THE POPLARS</h3>

<span class="i0">Of rose-conserves and Persian cats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lavender and Indian tea;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder sometimes as I pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they approve of me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">I give them greeting night and morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I like to think they answer, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that benign assurance born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When youth gives age the reverence due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bend their wise heads as I go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As courteous ladies do.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Long may you stand before my door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, kindly neighbours garbed in green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bend with rustling welcome o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The many friends who pass between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the little children play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look down with gracious mien.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Petunia fair, in flounce and furbelow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem to hear their whispers in each wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wanders 'mid the flowers. There they stand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the shadows of that apple tree!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are not dead, whom still it keeps in mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This garden, planted by some lovely hand<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Birds in those branches did sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blackbird and throstle and linnet,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Blackbird and throstle and linnet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i2">But blossoms to berries do come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All hanging on stalks light and slender,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one long summer's day charmed that lady away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With vows sweet and merry and tender;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lover with voice low and tender.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i2">Moss and lichen the green branches deck;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Weeds nod in its paths green and shady;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet a light footstep seems there to wander in dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ghost of that beautiful lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That happy and beautiful lady.<br /></span>

<h3>THE CHAMPA FLOWER</h3>

<p>Supposing I became a champa flower, just for fun, and
grew on a branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with
laughter and danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you
know me, mother?</p>

<p>You would call, "Baby, where are you?" and I should
laugh to myself and keep quite quiet.</p>

<p>I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.</p>

<p>When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders,
you walked through the shadow of the champa tree to the
little court where you say your prayers, you would notice the
scent of the flower, but not know that it came from me.</p>

<p>When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading
<i>Ramayana</i>, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your
lap, I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your
book, just where you were reading.</p>

<p>But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your
little child?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>When in the evening you went to the cow-shed with the lighted
lamp in your hand, I should suddenly drop on to the earth again
and be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, you naughty child?"</p>

<p>"I won't tell you, mother." That's what you and I would
say then.</p>

<span class="i0">There, in a spot that feels the sun, the swarthy egg-plant weaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great webs of frosted tapestry and hangs them out for leaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its funny azure blossoms give a merry, shrivelled wink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifting up the leaves display great drops of purple ink.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />

<span class="i0">The sweet potatoes rent the ground,&mdash;the egg-plant dropped his loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While every polished berry seemed to gain an added gloom.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">And, worst of all, there came a man, who once had planted them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dug that little family up by root and leaf and stem,<br /></span>

<h3>THE FLOWER-SCHOOL</h3>

<p>When storm clouds rumble in the sky and June showers
come down,</p>

<p>The moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow
its bagpipes among the bamboos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody
knows where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee.</p>

<p>Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground.</p>

<p>They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to
come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand
in a corner.</p>

<p>When the rains come down they have their holidays.</p>

<p>Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle
in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and
the flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and
white.</p>

<p>Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the
stars are.</p>

<p>Haven't you seen how eager they are to get there? Don't
you know why they are in such a hurry?</p>

<p>Of course, I can guess to whom they raise their arms: they
have their mother as I have my own.</p>

<span class="i0">And He set there an angel warden<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In a garment of light enfurled.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So near to the peace of Heaven,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With their shade and their sun-flecked sod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their lilies and bowers of roses,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were laid by the hand of God.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">The kiss of the sun for pardon,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beauty is silent,&mdash;through the summer day<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Green, full-leaved walls the fragrant sculpture hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm, orient blooms!&mdash;how motionless are they&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Speechless&mdash;the eternal loveliness untold!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He too is satisfied.<br /></span>

<h3>BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME</h3>

<blockquote><p>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden
a new sepulchre.... The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early
... unto the sepulchre.... And ... she turned herself back, and saw Jesus
standing.... Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
him ... Master. St. John.</p></blockquote>

<span class="i0">From silvering mid-sea to the Syrian sand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Sepulchre was open wide, and thrown<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A light wind stirred the Garden: everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smell of myrrh was out upon the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For three days He had traveled with the dead,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A moment it brawled upward and was gone&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There in the morning, on the old worn ways&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He would have gathered as a mother hen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathers her brood under her wings at night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then He saw the ages in one flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard as a great sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All of the griefs that had been and must be....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">As He stood looking on the endless sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the Garden went a sobbing cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned, and saw where the tall almonds are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Mary of Magdala, wildly pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast-fleeting down the trail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suddenly His face was like a star!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke; she knew&mdash;a blaze of happy tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then "Master!" ... and the word rings down the years!<br /></span>

<h3>"VESTURED AND VEILED WITH TWILIGHT"</h3>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Vestured and veiled with twilight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lulled in the winter's ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim, and happy, and silent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My garden dreams by its trees.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Urn of the sprayless fountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Glimmering nymph and faun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleam through the dark-plumed cedar,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fade on the dusky lawn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Here is no stir of summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here is no pulse of spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never a bud to burgeon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Never a bird to sing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Dreams&mdash;and the kingdom of quiet!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only the dead leaves lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the fallen roses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Under the shrouded sky.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Folded and fenced with silence<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mindless of moil and mart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is twilight here in my garden,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And twilight here in my heart.<br /></span>

<h3>THE FRUIT GARDEN PATH</h3>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">The path runs straight between the flowering rows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A moonlit path hemmed in by beds of bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where phlox and marigolds dispute for room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tall, red dahlias and the briar rose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis reckless prodigality which throws<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into the night these wafts of rich perfume<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which sweep across the garden like a plume.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the trees a single bright star glows.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dear garden of my childhood, here my years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have run away like little grains of sand;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The moments of my life, its hopes and fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have all found utterance here, where now I stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are my home, do you not understand?<br /></span>

<h3>WOOD SONG</h3>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">I heard a woodthrush in the dusk<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Twirl three notes and make a star&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart that walked with bitterness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Came back from very far.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Three shining notes were all he had,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And kissed it, scars and all.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Teach me, Father, how to go<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the wild world as a rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my spirit, propt with power,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">Teach me, Father, how to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind and patient as a tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joyfully the crickets croon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under shady oak at noon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beetle, on his mission bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tarries in that cooling tent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me, also, cheer a spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden field or garden grot&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Place where passing souls can rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the way and be their best.<br /></span>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
